# Strategy Pattern Documentation

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime. It enables you to select a specific algorithm or strategy dynamically, depending on the context or requirements.

## Implementation Overview

The implementation of the Strategy pattern for transaction processing involves the following key components:

1. **Transaction**: The base class representing a transaction. It contains common properties and methods shared by all transaction types. This class also defines an abstract method for executing the transaction.

2. **TransactionStrategy**: An interface that defines the contract for the transaction strategies. Each strategy class implementing this interface provides a specific implementation of the transaction execution logic.

3. **Concrete Strategy Classes**: Concrete classes that implement the `TransactionStrategy` interface and provide the actual implementation of executing a transaction for different strategies. Each concrete strategy class represents a specific way of performing a transaction.

## Code Structure

The code implementation follows a modular package structure for better organization and separation of concerns:

```plaintext
com.techforb.challenge
└── transaction
    ├── Transaction
    ├── Deposit
    ├── Transfer
    ├── Withdrawal
    └── TransactionStrategy
    └── strategy
        ├── TransactionStrategy
        ├── DepositStrategy
        ├── TransferStrategy
        └── WithdrawalStrategy
```

- The `transaction` package contains the core transaction classes, including the base `Transaction` class, concrete transaction subclasses (`Deposit`, `Transfer`, `Withdrawal`), and the `TransactionStrategy` interface.
- The `transaction.strategy` package contains the concrete strategy classes for each transaction type (`DepositStrategy`, `TransferStrategy`, `WithdrawalStrategy`).

## Usage

To utilize the Strategy pattern for transaction processing:

1. Create an instance of the desired transaction subclass (e.g., `Deposit`, `Transfer`, `Withdrawal`).
2. Call the `execute()` method on the transaction instance.
3. The transaction will internally invoke the appropriate strategy class based on its type and execute the transaction logic.

For example:

```java
Deposit deposit = new Deposit();
deposit.execute(); // Executes the deposit transaction using the DepositStrategy class.
```

By leveraging the Strategy pattern, you can easily add new transaction types or modify the transaction behavior without impacting the existing codebase. The strategy classes provide a flexible and interchangeable way to handle various transaction processing strategies.

## Benefits

- Enhances code modularity and maintainability by encapsulating each transaction strategy in a separate class.
- Allows easy addition of new transaction types or strategies without modifying existing code.
- Enables dynamic selection of transaction strategies at runtime.
- Supports code reuse and adheres to the Open/Closed principle.

## Considerations

- Choose appropriate strategy granularity to ensure that each strategy class encapsulates a distinct and meaningful behavior.
- Be mindful of performance implications when selecting strategies that involve complex computations or external dependencies.

## Conclusion

The Strategy pattern provides a flexible and extensible solution for implementing different transaction processing strategies. By encapsulating each strategy in a separate class and allowing dynamic selection of strategies, you can achieve a modular and maintainable codebase that is easily adaptable to changing requirements.
